A very small boardgame in JavaScript

https://rdentato.github.io/kitty/kitty.html

This is the result of an assignment for the course "Introduction to Game Design" on Coursera.

It is a simple boardgame (and somewhat confusing).

While the assignement was for a paper based game, I also created an online versione to test it and to give a proper feeling of how the game works.

I've created this repository to show how simple is to create small games in Javascript, with not even a single framework or external dependency.

Enjoy and feel free to reach me for questions, feedback and comments.
